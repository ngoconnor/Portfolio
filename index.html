        <p>My name is Naomi O'Connor and I currently reside in North Carolina, where I have been living for 20 years. My main goal is to eventually move out of North Carolina and explore new areas of the world, no preference.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-title">What are my passions and interests?</h3>
      <p>
        As a former restaurant server, my highlights are:
        <ul class="list-inside">
          <li>Staying efficient and maintaining flexibility under pressure.</li>
          <li>Working as a team when things become chaotic in the workplace.</li>
          <li>Keeping a positive attitude even when things go wrong.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The main reasons I have decided to go into the web development industry is because:
        <ol class="list-inside">
          <li>I enjoyed making MySpace layouts so much, I want to go more in depth with that.</li>
          <li>I am always around computers so I would love to learn more about them.</li>
          <li>Computers will be around for a long time, so there is a high chance I will succeed in committing to web development.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of web development, I also enjoy photography. I was part of my university's school newspaper staff, and I was able to go to many sports events and take close-up photos. Having said that, I have learned a little bit of photoshop and photo-editing which I will do in my free time. In addition to that, I also enjoy singing and have been part of several choirs and emsembles. Singing releases stress and brightens up my mood.
